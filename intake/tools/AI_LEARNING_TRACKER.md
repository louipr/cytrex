**Problem Identified:** Agent cognitive overload during document processing leads to chat dumping and quality degradation.
**Solution:** Hybrid approach with programmatic scaffolding + agent reasoning + programmatic validation.

## LEARNING SESSION TRACKING

### Current Session: Claude Sonnet (GitHub Copilot)
**Start Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Phase 1.2 Implementation

#### Phase Progress:
- ✅ **Phase 1.1:** Exam draft skeleton created (IMPROVED - cleaner flow)
- 🔄 **Phase 1.2:** HYBRID APPROACH - In Progress
  - ✅ Step A: generate-learning-template (COMPLETED - template in context/)
  - ✅ Step B: Document evidence collection (COMPLETED - 7 docs, 37 domains)
  - ✅ Step C: validate-evidence (PASSED - evidence validated)  
  - 🔄 Step D: Populate exam draft skeleton (READY - skeleton available)
  - ✅ Step E: assemble-exam (command implemented)
- ⏸️ **Phase 1.3:** Validate exam (waiting for Phase 1.2)

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **Document Processing Overload:** Attempted to process 8,500+ lines in memory, led to chat dumping
2. **File Management Error:** Created exam.jsonl instead of appending to exam.yaml
3. **Process Gap:** Missing intermediate evidence structure between reading and question creation

#### Solutions Applied:
1. **Hybrid Architecture:** Programmatic templates + agent reasoning + validation
2. **Evidence Trail:** learning_evidence.yaml tracks systematic document processing
3. **Command Integration:** New unified commands for each step

#### Next Actions:
1. Implement `generate-learning-template` command
2. Implement `validate-evidence` command  
3. Implement `assemble-exam` command
4. Test hybrid approach on cytrex documents
5. Complete Phase 1.2 with new methodology

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Required New Commands:
- ✅ `generate-learning-template` - Creates structured template (WORKING)
- ✅ `validate-evidence` - Validates learning_evidence.yaml completeness (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ `assemble-exam` - Combines evidence + questions into final exam.yaml (IMPLEMENTED)

### Files Created This Session:
- ✅ `AGENT_LEARNING_GUIDE.md` - Updated with hybrid approach
- ✅ `AI_LEARNING_TRACKER.md` - This tracking file
- ✅ `context/learning_template.yaml` - Created with 7 documents structure
- ✅ `context/learning_evidence.yaml` - COMPLETED - 37 technical domains
- ✅ `context/exam_draft.yaml` - COMPLETED - 30 questions with solutions
- ✅ `exam/exam.yaml` - FINAL EXAM with full audit trail

### Quality Metrics:
- **Documents to Process:** 7 files (8,500+ lines total)
- **Target Questions:** 25-30 covering ALL technical domains
- **Evidence Traceability:** Each question must trace to specific document sections
- **Coverage Requirement:** All 7 documents must contribute to exam content

## METHODOLOGY INSIGHTS

### What Works:
- Programmatic scaffolding prevents cognitive overload
- Evidence files create audit trails
- Step-by-step validation catches shortcuts
- Unified command structure maintains consistency

### What Doesn't Work:
- Pure manual processing (leads to chat dumping)
- Large jumps between steps (quality degradation)
- Missing intermediate validation (allows shortcuts)

### Key Learnings:
1. **Hybrid > Pure Manual:** Programmatic structure + agent reasoning
2. **Evidence Trail Essential:** Must trace all conclusions to sources
3. **Validation Checkpoints:** Prevent quality degradation under pressure
4. **Command Integration:** Unified tools reduce complexity
