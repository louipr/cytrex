      "id": "Q001",
      "question": "What are the three core components required for AST parsing in TypeScript code analysis?",
      "answer": "Based on my knowledge, AST parsing requires: (1) Support for ES2022+ syntax, (2) TypeScript 5.0+ compatibility, and (3) Symbol resolution capabilities including cross-file symbol tracking, type alias resolution, and interface implementation tracking.",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Citing knowledge entries K001 and K003 from my knowledge base. K001 states AST parsing requires ES2022+ syntax and TypeScript 5.0+ compatibility. K003 covers symbol resolution components. However, I don't have a complete third distinct component clearly separated in my knowledge base."
    },
    {
      "id": "Q002",
      "question": "How does call graph construction enable detection of orphaned functions?",
      "answer": "Call graph construction enables orphaned function detection by tracing all function calls from entry points and tracking method invocations across modules. Functions not reachable through this tracing would be considered orphaned.",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "reasoning": "Citing knowledge entries K002 and K004. K002 explains call graph construction traces function calls from entry points and tracks method invocations. K004 mentions orphaned functions/methods as part of dead code detection. The connection is logical based on reachability analysis."

      "confidence": 0.80,
      "reasoning": "Citing knowledge entries K001 and K009. K001 mentions TypeScript 5.0+ compatibility requirement. K009 provides additional TypeScript-specific features. However, my knowledge doesn't provide comprehensive details about specific 5.0+ features."
